## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

I have become much more confident with CSS grid and flexbox.  I have also become slightly better with the alignment properties.

I was able to create a complex grid and make it responsible for mobile and tablets.

### Continued development

Start using CSS Grid to build more complex designs and use more semantic markup.
